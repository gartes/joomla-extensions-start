# Boilerplate
Boilerplate files for Joomla! extensions

# Installation
The boilerplates can be installed as-is using the Extension Manager. However, the component, module and plugin will be called Foo :)

To create installable zip packages, you only need to zip the folder with the files and it is ready to be installed.

# Customizing
To customize the boilerplates using your own name you need to take the following steps:

1. Do a **case-sensitive** replace on the following strings and replace them with your own name:
   * foo
   * Foo
   * FOO
2. Do a **case-sensitive** replace on the following tags with their actual information:
   * [DATE]
   * [PROJECT_NAME]
   * [AUTHOR]
   * [AUTHOR_EMAIL]
   * [AUTHOR_URL]
   * [COPYRIGHT]
   * [PACKAGE_NAME]
